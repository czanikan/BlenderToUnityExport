# Blender Add-on: Export to Unity

Simple add-on for exporting selected mesh/meshes to unity compatible fbx format.
Basically, I made it for myself to speed up my workflow and make it more comfortable. But I make it available to anyone who wants to use it.

## Usage

* Go to Object > Export to Unity.
* You will find a folder called "FBX" on your Desktop.
